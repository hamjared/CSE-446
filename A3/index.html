  <h1>CSE 446 - Project 2 - A3</h1>
  <h3>Jared Ham</h3>

  The application I created for this assignment is a basic console app, that allows the user to login and send messages. It was originally planned to make use of the
  message sending service on the ASU service repository, but that service was not working as of the deadline for this project. So I just used the file store service in the ASU service repository
  instead. It functions well enought for the purposes of this project.


  I created the login/ Sign up services used by the application. Both of these functions make use of Code Activities.
  <ul>
    <li>CreateUser(string userName, string password)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Takes a user name and password, checks if the user name is in use and if not creates the user</li>
    </ul>

    <li>login(string userName, string password)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Takes a user name and password and searches the users json file stored in app data for a matching user name, then checks if the passwords match. If they do the login is successful</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

<h3>How to test</h3>
There are currently 3 users already created:
<ul>
  <li>Username: Jared Password: password</li>
  <li>Username: Joe Password: pass</li>
  <li>Username: Bill Password: new</li>
</ul>

You can login as either of these users and send messages from one account to the other. You can also create new users through the console app.

Here is a screenshot of the console app showing how to test signing up, logging in, sending messages, receiving message and clearing messages

And here is another test case showing sending multiple messages to the same user
